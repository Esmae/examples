! OPTIM input to use with PATHSAMPLE and LJ38

! use the connection algorithm of Carr, Trygubenko and Wales to find a path between the endpoints specified with:
! - a maximum of 4 connection cycles
! - only 1 connection attempt for any pair of local minima
! - DNEB image density of 20 (number of images = 20 x distance) 
! - DNEB iteration density of 20 (optimisation iterations = 20 x number of images)
! - a maximum of 5 DNEB images
! - no additional images per connection attempt (only doing 1 per pair)
! - a DNEB RMS force convergence condition of 0.025
! for further details of the parameters, see the OPTIM documentation
NEWCONNECT 4 1 20.0 20.0 5 0.0 0.025

! specifies the value of the DNEB force constant to use between images 
NEBK 10.0

! specifies that a missing connection Dijkstra-based algorithm should be used to choose minima for connection in cycles of NEWCONNECT
! the edge weights used are distances raised to the power of 1 
DIJKSTRA 1

! when aligning structures, minimise the distance between stationary points with respect to permutational isomerisation
! as we are nor providing a perm.allow file, all atoms are considered to be identical
PERMDIST 0.01D0
! try 5 random starting alignments as well as the standard one when using PERMDIST
RANROT 5

! define the energy and distance cutoffs below which we assume structures are identical
EDIFFTOL 1.0D-6
GEOMDIFFTOL 0.2

! specify the RMS force convergence criterion for the L-BFGS minimiser 
BFGSMIN  1.0D-6
! set the history size of the L-BFGS algorithm to 100
UPDATES 100 100
! the size of step to take away from a stationary point of the wrong index if encountered
PUSHOFF 0.02
! if the provided endpoints have an RMS force greater than BFGSMIN, re-minimise them
REOPTIMISEENDPOINTS
! the maximum number of steps for any one L-BFGS minimisation
BFGSSTEPS 5000
! the maximum step size for both normal and Rayleigh-Ritz minimisation
MAXBFGS 0.2 0.2
! the maximum number of optimisation steps
STEPS    200

! transition states will be located using a hybrid BFGS/eigenvector following approach
BFGSTS  50 3 25 0.0001
! the maximum step size during hybrid eigenvector-following
MAXSTEP 0.1
! the upper limit for the maximum hybrid eigenvector following step size
MAXMAX  0.2
! set the trust radius used in eigenvector following
TRAD 0.2
! do not calculate the Hessian during geometry optimisation. Rayleigh-Ritz minimisation is used instead
! to find the smallest eigenvalue and its eigenvector
NOHESS

! create a path.info file containing info on every min-ts-min triple found, on and off pathway
! this is often used as input for PATHSAMPLE to create a database 
DUMPALLPATHS
! specify that we want up to 3 additional frames to be printed between each min-ts-min triple
PATH   3

! contains particles with a sphere of radius 5 (used to prevent evaporation)
RADIUS 5.0

! when using PATHSAMPLE, the starting coordinates are appended to the odata.connect file
! hence we don't have any below POINTS here
