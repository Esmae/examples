! ALGORITHM SETUP

! Specify the RMS force convergence criteria for:
! quenches (Qu) during the basin-hopping (BH) run
SLOPPYCONV 5.0D-3
! final quenches for the SAVE lowest energy minima
TIGHTCONV 1.0D-3 

! Consider minima unique if they differ by less than 0.003 
EDIFF 0.003

! Set the max number of minimisation steps for sloppy and tight quenches
MAXIT 600 500 

! Tightly converge and output the 2 lowest energy structures
SAVE 2

! Centre the structure after each quench
CENTRE

! Sort the atoms by how strongly bound they are 
SORT  

! Output additional files to aid analysis of the run:
! produce best, markov and energy files containing those energies each quench
TRACKDATA
! calculate pair energies and atom types every 100 steps and dump XYZs
MONITOR 100
! produce a GMIN dump file for use with RESTORE every 6000 BH steps
DUMPINT 6000

! SAMPLING PARAMETERS

! Set the temperature used when accepting and rejecting minima into the Markov
! chain (multiples of kT in the underlying energy units)
TEMPERATURE 1.0
! Alternative temperatures to try
! TEMPERATURE 0.1
! TEMPERATURE 3.0

! Do 5000 BH steps multiplying the temperate by 1.0 each step
STEPS 5000 1.0

! Generate new geometries each BH step by apply a random Cartesian displacement
! of up to 0.4 to each LJ atom and an angular step to each atom with binding
! energy less than 0.51
STEP 0.40 0.51
! Alternative STEP sizes to try
! STEP 0.10 0.51
! STEP 1.00 0.51

! ADVANCED SAMPLING METHODS

! If energy has not decreased in 40 BH steps, add the minimum we got stuck in 
! to a cyclic AVOID list (see below)
NEWRESTART 40

! Reseed if the current minimum is within a distance of 4.0 of the 20 members
! of the cyclic AVOID list populated by NEWRESTART
AVOID 4.0 20 F
