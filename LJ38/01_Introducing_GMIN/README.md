# Example 1 - Introducing GMIN

GMIN aims to efficiently locate the global minimum of a system by employing the basin-hopping methodology. 
Here we use it to find the two lowest energy minima for a cluster of 38 Lennard-Jones particles, known as LJ38.

## Input files
This directory (and the backup in the input subdirectory) contains all the files you need to run GMIN for LJ38:

- *data* -	Some input files are optional, but every GMIN job requires a ‘data’ file containing the keywords used to specify how the run should proceed. 
		The keywords we are using here are detailed in the ‘data_annotated’ file. For information on the full set of keywords available, check the 
		[GMIN website](http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/GMIN).
