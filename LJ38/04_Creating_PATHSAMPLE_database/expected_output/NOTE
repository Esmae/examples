Note that this expected output includes: 

- modified min.A and min.B files to use the initial OPTIM endpoints
- files from a Dijkstra calculation (see STEP 2 in pathdata)
- a disconnectivity graph (tree.ps) generated by disconnectionDPS

As a result, you will not get exactly the same output just running PATHSAMPLE on the files in the input directory.
