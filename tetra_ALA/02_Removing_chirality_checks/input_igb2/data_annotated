! ALGORITHM SETUP

! Optionally stop the GMIN run when the global minimum is found
! This is not enabled by default as you don't usually know it's energy!
! TARGET -43.37767556 

! Specify a seed for the random number generator to make stochastic moves repeatable 
RANSEED 12345

! Disable chirality checks (not usually recommended!)
NOCHIRALCHECKS

! Specify the RMS force convergence criteria for:
! quenches (Qu) during the basin-hopping (BH) run
SLOPPYCONV 1.0D-4
! final quenches for the SAVE lowest energy minima
TIGHTCONV 1.0D-6 

! Consider minima unique if they differ by less than 0.00001
EDIFF 1.0D-5

! Set the max number of minimisation steps for sloppy and tight quenches
MAXIT 1000 1000 

! Target a Metropolis acceptance ratio of 0.3 (30% of new structures accepted)
ACCEPTRATIO 0.3

! Set the memory size of the L-BFGS minimiser to 100 steps 
UPDATES 100

! Set the maximum allowed energy rise during minimisation to 0.0001 kcal/mol 
MAXERISE 1.0D-4

! Tightly converge and output the 10 lowest energy structures
SAVE 10

! Centre the structure after each quench
CENTRE
! Constrain the system within a sphere of radius 300A
RADIUS 300

! Output additional files to aid analysis of the run:
! produce best, markov and energy files containing those energies each quench
TRACKDATA
! produce a GMIN dump file for use with RESTORE every 6000 BH steps
DUMPINT 6000

! SAMPLING PARAMETERS

! Set the temperature used when accepting and rejecting minima into the Markov
! chain (multiple of kT in the underlying energy units, here 1.0 kcal/mol = 504K)
TEMPERATURE 1.0

! Do 1000 BH steps multiplying the temperature by 1.0 each step
STEPS 1000 1.0

! Generate new geometries each BH step by apply a random Cartesian displacement
! of up to 1.0 to each atom and no angular step (0.0)
STEP 1.0 0.0
! Perform a GROUPROTATION move every 5 steps (see atomgroups)
GROUPROTATION 5 

! Produce additional output files when using AMBER including .pdb and .rst files for each SAVEd minimum
DUMPSTRUCTURES

! Use the AMBER 9 potential reading in initial coordinates from the 'coords.inpcrd' file in inpcrd/rst format
AMBER9 coords.inpcrd inpcrd
