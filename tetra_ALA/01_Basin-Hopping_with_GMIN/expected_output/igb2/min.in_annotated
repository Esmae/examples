AMBER input file used to return the energy from sander when running GMIN
 &cntrl
! specify that we want to run a single point energy calculation, not molecular dynamics
  imin   = 1,
! ask for only a single cycle of steepest descent and conjugate gradient minimisation
! this simply returns an energy and makes no change to the structure
  ncyc = 1,
  maxcyc = 1,
! use the GB(OCB) Generalised Born implicit solvation approach
  igb = 2,
! do not use periodic boundary conditions
  ntb    = 0,
! do not use a non-bonded interaction cutoff
  cut    = 999.99
