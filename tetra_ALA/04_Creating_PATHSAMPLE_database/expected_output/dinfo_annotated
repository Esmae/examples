! disconnectionDPS input to generate a disconnectivity graph for trypzip
! Further details and a full keyword listing can be found in the source code

! REQUIRED KEYWORDS

! the energy seperation used when performing the basin analysis  
DELTA 0.5
! the highest energy on the axis 
FIRST -28.0
! the number of levels at which to perform the basin analysis
! also specifies the energy range, from FIRST to FIRST - (DELTA * LEVELS)  
LEVELS 30
! the PATHSAMPLE file containing the minima  
MINIMA min.data
! the PATHSAMPLE file containing the transition states
TS ts.data

! OPTIONAL KEYWORDS

! ignore transition states above this energy 
MAXTSENERGY 10.0
! minima with 0 or fewer (!) connections are discarded
NCONNMIN 0
! connection analysis should be based on minimum 3 (the global minimum)  
! may require changing if min.A contains something else - if in doubt remove 
CONNECTMIN 3
! attempt to place the branch containing the global minimum near the centre 
CENTREGMIN
! label minima 1 and 39 (the folded and unfolded endpoints) on the disconnectivity graph
IDMIN 3
IDMIN 7

! label all minima in 5pt font - useful for identifying minima of interest to extract 
! initially commented for clarity
! IDENTIFY
! LABELSIZE 5
