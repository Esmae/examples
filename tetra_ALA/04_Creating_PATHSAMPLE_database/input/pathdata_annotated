! PATHSAMPLE input to create an initial database from A12OPTIM path.info for tetra-ALA (ALA-ALA-ALA-ALA)
! For further details, see the PATHSAMPLE documentation

! the path to the A12OPTIM binary to use
EXEC           /home/energy/workshop/binaries/A12OPTIM
! run A12OPTIM locally on a single core - modify as appropriate
CPUS           1
! the number of atoms in the system
NATOMS         52
! specify the random number seed, used to make calculations repeatable
SEED           1
! specify the direction of the pathway using spectroscopic convention i.e. AB = A<-B where A and B are the endpoints
! in min.A and min.B respectively
DIRECTION      AB
! minimum number of connected minima to be found for new minimum
CONNECTIONS    1
! specify the temperature to use when calculating rate constants 
! 0.592 kcal/mol = 298K
TEMPERATURE    0.592
! specify the value of Planck's constant in kcal/mol
PLANCK         9.536D-14

! when aligning structures, minimise the distance between stationary points with respect to permutational isomerisation
! the groups of atoms to be considered identical are described in the perm.allow file
PERMDIST 
! define the energy and distance cutoffs below which we assume structures are identical - matches odata.connect
ETOL           1.0D-5
GEOMDIFFTOL    0.1D0
! additionally use a principal moment of inertia tensor difference criterion for distinguishing stationary points
ITOL           0.1D0

! STEP 1: creating the initial database from A12OPTIM path.info file
! use the stationary points in path.info.initial to create an initial PATHSAMPLE database
! min.A and min.B are set to 1 and 2 as a baseline to be changed 
STARTFROMPATH  path.info.initial 1 2
! don't run any A12OPTIM connection cycles - we only want to set the database up at this point
CYCLES         0

! STEP 2: run a Dijkstra analysis to identify the 'fastest path' (initially commented) 
! perform a Dijkstra analysis, ignoring any minima with 0 or less connections
! DIJKSTRA       0
! don't run any A12OPTIM connection cycles, we only want to identify the fastest path
! CYCLES         0

! specify that we are using the AMBER potential via an interface to AMBER 12
