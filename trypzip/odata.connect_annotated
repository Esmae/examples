! OPTIM input to use with PATHSAMPLE and trypzip

! use the connection algorithm of Carr, Trygubenko and Wales to find a path between the endpoints specified with:
! - a maximum of 10 connection cycles
! - 3 connection attempts for any pair of local minima
! - DNEB image density of 2 (number of images = 2 x distance) 
! - DNEB iteration density of 20 (optimisation iterations = 20 x number of images)
! - a maximum of 30 DNEB images
! - 0.5 additional images per connection attempt
! for further details of the parameters, see the OPTIM documentation
NEWCONNECT 10 3 2.0 20.0 30 0.5

! specifies the value of the DNEB force constant to use between images 
NEBK 10.0

! specifies that a missing connection Dijkstra-based algorithm should be used to choose minima for connection in cycles of NEWCONNECT
! the edge weights used are distances are exponentiated (watch out for overflow with large distances!)
DIJKSTRA EXP

! when aligning structures, minimise the distance between stationary points with respect to permutational isomerisation
! as we are not providing a perm.allow file, all atoms are considered to be identical
PERMDIST 

! define the energy and distance cutoffs below which we assume structures are identical
EDIFFTOL 1.0D-4
GEOMDIFFTOL 0.1D0

! specify the RMS force convergence criterion for the L-BFGS minimiser 
BFGSMIN  1.0D-6
! set the history size of the L-BFGS algorithm to 1500
UPDATES 1500
! the size of step to take away from a stationary point of the wrong index if encountered
PUSHOFF 0.1
! if the provided endpoints have an RMS force greater than BFGSMIN, re-minimise them
REOPTIMISEENDPOINTS
! the maximum number of steps for any one L-BFGS minimisation
BFGSSTEPS 5000
! the maximum step size for both normal and Rayleigh-Ritz minimisation
MAXBFGS 0.1
! the maximum number of optimisation steps
STEPS 5000

! transition states will be located using a hybrid BFGS/eigenvector following approach
! - up to 1000 iterations allowed in the calculation of the smallest Hessian eigenvalue
! - up to 20 BFGS steps allowed in the subspace minimisation before eigenvalue convergence
! - up to 200 BFGS steps allowed in the subspace minimisation after eigenvalue convergence
! - 'RMS force' convergence criterion of 0.01 for the calculation of the smallest non-zero Hessian eigenvalue
BFGSTS 1000 20 200 0.01
! the maximum step size during hybrid eigenvector-following
MAXSTEP 0.1
! the upper limit for the maximum hybrid eigenvector following step size
MAXMAX  0.3
! set the trust radius used in eigenvector following
TRAD 0.2
! reduce the maximum step size in BFGSTS if the smallest non-zero eigenvalue is positive
CHECKNEGATIVE
! do not calculate the Hessian during geometry optimisation. Rayleigh-Ritz minimisation is used instead
! to find the smallest eigenvalue and its eigenvector
NOHESS
! specifies the second order central differences method in Rayleigh-Ritz BFGSTS using a formulation that minimises the rounding error
USEDIAG 2

! allow up to a 0.0001 rise in the energy during L-BFGS minimisation and 1.0 in the Rayleigh-Ritz ratio during BFGSTS
MAXERISE 1.0D-4 1.0D0

! create a path.info file containing info on every min-ts-min triple found, on and off pathway
! this is often used as input for PATHSAMPLE to create a database 
DUMPALLPATHS

! LEFT IN FOR TESTING ONLY
! DUMPSP
! DUMPDATA

! specify that we are using the AMBER potential via an interface to AMBER 9
! initial coordinates will be read from start in (x,y,z) format
AMBER9 start

! when using PATHSAMPLE, the starting coordinates are appended to the odata.connect file
! hence we don't have any below POINTS here
