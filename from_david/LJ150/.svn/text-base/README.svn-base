Created a test2.vmd file with the required representations.

Replaces top by [molinfo top] in all the clipplane lines for this to
source cleanly in the Tk window.

source refresh2.tcl in the Tk window.

Must remove any loaded molecules before running the script.

Can invoke vmd with

xterm -e vmd -size 1024 768 -e refresh2.tcl

Now we just need a startup script to create random coordinates from
a seed based on the input date, start GMIN, and start vmd as above.
