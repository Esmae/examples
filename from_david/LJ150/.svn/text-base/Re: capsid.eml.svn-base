In the meanwhile I figured out why drawing the labels is non-trivial for
your systems. It is because of the vmd saved state, which has saved
viewpoints, i.e. the location of the viewer is inconsistent with the axes
displayed. The viewpoint rotates the coordinate system. So, in order to
restore a proper viewpoint, and plot the labels accordingly, you need to do
the following:

use a unity matrix for the rotation part of the viewpoint definition:
instead of something like this in the .vmd file:
#        set viewpoint1 {{{1 0 0 0} {0 1 0 0} {0 0 1 0} {0 0 0 1}}
{{0.0751302 0.99718 0.00312002 0} {0.175742 -0.0163486 0.984398 0} {0.981599
-0.0733911 -0.176467 0} {0 0 0 1}} {{0.250351 0 0 0} {0 0.250351 0 0} {0 0
0.250351 0} {0 0 0 1}} {{1 0 0 -1.02} {0 1 0 0.03} {0 0 1 0} {0 0 0 1}}}
use:
set viewpoint1 {{{1 0 0 0} {0 1 0 0} {0 0 1 0} {0 0 0 1}} {{1 0 0 0} {0 1 0
0} {0 0 1 0} {0 0 0 1}} {{0.25 0 0 0} {0 0.25 0 0} {0 0 0.25 0} {0 0 0 1}}
{{1 0 0 -1.02} {0 1 0 0.03} {0 0 1 0} {0 0 0 1}}}
The stuff with 0.25 0 0 0 etc. is the matrix with scale factors, and that
can be used to scale the structures up or down.

and to draw the label at the bottom, use:

draw text {0 -2.5 0} "$line"

Best wishes,
Szilard

Thanks!

I'm using 1024x768 because all projectors should be able to do this!

Best wishes,
